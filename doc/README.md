# About the Project
Our system is called JavaWookies Time Tracking System.
The Javawookies Time Tracking System is a Login/Logout application that allows two (2) types of users to log in. The users are classified into Employee and Admin, and both can sign in to their specific accounts and view the corresponding details. The user Employee has the ability to check its login/logout details on that day, while the user Admin has the ability to add, delete, and edit information of recent and former employees. Also, Admin can generate reports if needed to see who are the employees that logged in on that specified date. The system stores password on a manual basis, for now. This means that the user Employee cannot reset it; only the Admin can change the password manually to the Employee's specific account details. The system records the time of a specific user who logs in or out based on the local machine's timer.
The Javawookies Time Tracking System is a desktop/laptop application targeted at small- to medium-sized businesses. Using this system, employers can keep track of the time-in and time-out (TITO) of their employees, view their time logs, and register newly hired employees to the database. In addition, they can also incorporate images of their company logo into this system's design. This application runs in real-time.
